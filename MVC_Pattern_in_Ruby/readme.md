Broken Spaghetti Code

## Fixes on Section 3

1. The API endpoint for his data has changed. Change the API endpoint to the new URL.
2. The data you want in the JSON is now located at [‘photos’] instead of [‘data’]. Update the code to reflect that.
3. To let the JSON more readable, instead of accessing product['loc'], you access product['location'] to get the location name for each vacation photo.
4. Change the header logo.
